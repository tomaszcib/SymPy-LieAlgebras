This package provides basic implementation of arbitrary finite-dimensional Lie algebras for the free and open source [SymPy](https://github.com/sympy/sympy) computer algebra system. It features:
* definition of Lie algebras by their basis and defining Lie bracket operation on basis elements,
* calculating the Lie bracket on elements of Lie algebras,
* subalgebras,
* product ideals,
* lower central series and derived series,
* adjoint representations,
* solvable radical,
* nilradical,
* Levi decomposition,
* universal enveloping algebras and basic operations within them

## Installation
Make sure you have installed SymPy package for your Python environment. You can do so by executing:
```
pip install --user sympy
```
All you have to do now is to download and unpack this repository. Import the `LieAlgebra` class from the `LieAlgebra.py` file and you are ready to start your computations.

## Usage and documentation
Overview of files and documentation of the package can be found in the [wiki page](https://github.com/tomaszcib/SymPy-LieAlgebras/wiki) of the project.
